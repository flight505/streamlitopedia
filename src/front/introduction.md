# Introduction

This is a collection of tools, code snippets, and ideas that I've found helpful when making [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) apps. 

These are essentially a public version of notes I was taking on patterns that emerged built some apps. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list of anything, but I wanted to make them public in case others find these ideas helpful.

Much of the content is from an article I wrote called [Intermediate Streamlit](https://towardsdatascience.com/intermediate-streamlit-d5a1381daa65?source=friends_link&sk=7badbd5f047a234cd70784a438082a76). The content that is new is all of the [Design](../essentials.md) content and an updated page on using [Markdown](../markdown.md). 

Some notes:
1. Use the table of contents on the left to navigate.
2. The magnifying glass in the header is a search button you can use to search the full text of these notes.
3. If you find any errors feel free to [open a PR](https://github.com/pmbaumgartner/streamlitopedia/pulls).

Thanks for reading.
